title: "X-Drupal-Cache-Tags Header Disabled"
class: \Drutiny\Http\Audit\HttpHeaderNotExists
name: HTTP:X-Drupal-Cache-Tags
description: |
  X-Drupal-Cache-Tags is a debugging HTTP header Drupal sends to inform developers
  what cache tags are being utilised in an HTTP response. The header can be high
  verbosity on responses that use a lot of entities from both content and
  configuration.

  This header should only be used in local development or in environment specific
  debugging.
remediation: |
  The X-Drupal-Cache-Tags header can be disabled by setting `http.response.debug_cacheability_headers`
  to `false` in the `services.yml` file.
