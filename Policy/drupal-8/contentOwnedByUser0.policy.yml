description: |
  Content owned by a user that is not expected can pose a security risk whereby
  untrusted users might be able to include malicious code in content. If the
  unexpected user is "Anonymous", this could mean any site visitor could present
  a risk if they entered malicious code into content. This policy identifies if
  there are nodes owned by Drupal's Anonymous User.
remediation: |
  Assess whether or not there is a legitimate reason that nodes should be owned
  by Drupal's Anonymous User on the site. If not, assign the appropriate owner
  to the content.
success: No nodes are owned by Drupal's Anonymous User.
failure: |
  Content was discovered that is owned by the Drupal anonymous user.
