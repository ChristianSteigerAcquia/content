    When utilising other page cache services, it is recommended not to use Drupal's
    page caching backend as it can cause caching issues with other caching services
    in front of it.

    As its not possible to assign no cache backend to the render cache, it is
    recommended to instead set the render cache to use the memory backend.

remediation: |
  Please ensure the memory cache backend is set as the cache backend for the render cache:

  ```
  $settings['cache']['render'] = 'cache.backend.memory';
  ```
success: The render cache is using the memory cache backend.
failure: The render cache is not using the memory cache backend.
parameters:
  key:

      The key in settings.php to check. Use dot syntax to traverse settings array.
    default: cache.render
  value:
    type: string

      The value that should be set if the settings key exists.
    default: cache.backend.memory
