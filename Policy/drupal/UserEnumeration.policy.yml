  User enumeration is when a malicious actor can use brute-force to either guess
  or confirm valid users in a system. User enumeration is often a web
  application vulnerability, though it can also be found in any system that
  requires user authentication. Two of the most common areas where user
  enumeration occurs are in a site's login page and its â€˜Forgot Password'
  functionality.

  User enumeration is a default vulnerability in Drupal but can be mitigated
  through the use of the
  [Username Enumeration Prevention](https://www.drupal.org/project/username_enumeration_prevention)
  module.
remediation: Enable the Username Enumeration Prevention module.
success: The Username Enumeration Prevention module is enabled.
failure: The Username Enumeration Prevention module is not enabled.
parameters:
  module:
    default: username_enumeration_prevention
