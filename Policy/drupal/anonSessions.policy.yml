description: |
  If you are generating sessions for anonymous users, you are causing a major
  performance impact to your site. Having anonymous sessions will break
  traditional page caching in Varnish and CDNs.
remediation: |
  Find out what modules are causing the sessions, and look to remove them.
success: There are no anonymous sessions.
failure: |
  Anonymous sessions were detected in the sessions table. Found {{count}} sessions.

  Session data is verbose and cryptic in nature and as such, the full extent of
  the session data cannot be shown in this report. Below is an extract of session
  data stored in the first record found:

  ```
  {{first_row.session}}
  ```

  The most recent anonymous session was recorded at {{first_row.date}} UTC.
parameters:
  expression:
    default: count == 0
  query:
    default: |
      SELECT session, FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp) as date FROM sessions
      WHERE uid = 0
        AND session NOT LIKE 'openid%'
        AND session NOT LIKE '%Access denied%'
      ORDER BY timestamp DESC
      LIMIT 1000
